# Parallel Rug Pull Insurance - Architecture Design

## Project Goal
Create a **high-throughput rug pull insurance protocol** that leverages Arcology's parallel execution capabilities to process thousands of policies and claims simultaneously. This project is designed to win the **Arcology EthOnline Track ($5,000 prize)** by demonstrating deep understanding of blockchain-native concurrency.

## Competition Requirements

### Arcology Track Criteria
- ✅ **Effective use of Arcology's parallel execution features**
- ✅ **Creativity and originality of the project**
- ✅ **Real-world scalability and developer impact**
- ✅ **Scripts to generate transaction batches for benchmarking**
- ✅ **Deploy and run on Arcology DevNet**
- ⚠️ **No UI/UX required** - focus on smart contracts and execution logic

### Key Focus Areas (from Arcology team)
> "Our main focus is not just the complexity of your idea, but **how well you apply Arcology's parallel execution**. The key is understanding the nuances of blockchain native concurrency — **how to manage contention, concurrent state access, and make the most of our concurrent library**."

## Core Concept: Rug Pull Insurance

### Business Logic
Insurance protocol that protects users against rug pulls by:
1. Users purchase insurance policies for specific tokens
2. Pay premiums based on coverage amount, duration, and risk factors
3. If token price crashes (rug pull detected), users file claims
4. Claims are automatically validated against price oracles
5. Approved claims receive instant payouts

### Why This Works for Parallel Execution
- **Independent user operations**: Each user's policy is isolated
- **Batch processing**: Process 1000s of policies/claims simultaneously
- **No owner bottleneck**: Automated oracle-based claim settlement
- **Natural parallelism**: Different tokens = different storage paths
- **Commutative operations**: Premium pool additions are order-independent

## Parallel Architecture Design

### 1. Data Structure Strategy

#### ❌ Sequential (Standard Solidity)
```solidity
mapping(bytes32 => Policy) public policies;           // Sequential access
mapping(address => bytes32[]) public userPolicies;    // Array conflicts
uint256 public totalPolicies;                         // Write contention
uint256 public totalCoverage;                         // Write contention
uint256 public totalPremiums;                         // Write contention
```
**Problem**: Every policy creation touches same global counters → Sequential execution

#### ✅ Parallel (Arcology Concurrent)
```solidity
// Commutative counters - no contention
U256Cumulative public totalPolicies;
U256Cumulative public totalCoverage;
U256Cumulative public totalPremiums;

// Concurrent maps - independent storage paths
AddressU256CumMap public userPolicyCount;         // Track policy count per user
AddressU256CumMap public userTotalCoverage;       // Track coverage per user
HashU256CumMap public tokenRiskScores;            // Risk score per token

// Per-policy storage (independent access)
mapping(bytes32 => Policy) public policies;       // No contention (unique IDs)
```

### 2. Concurrent Operations

#### Policy Creation (Parallel)
```solidity
function createPolicy(
    address tokenAddress,
    uint256 coverageAmount,
    uint256 duration
) external returns (bytes32) {
    // ✅ Each operation uses concurrent primitives
    totalPolicies.add(1);                    // Commutative addition
    totalCoverage.add(coverageAmount);       // Commutative addition
    totalPremiums.add(premium);              // Commutative addition
    userPolicyCount.set(msg.sender, 1);      // Independent user storage

    // ✅ Unique policy ID = no contention
    bytes32 policyId = keccak256(...unique data...);
    policies[policyId] = Policy(...);
}
```
**Parallelism**: 1000 users can create policies simultaneously with zero conflicts

#### Batch Policy Creation (Multiprocess)
```solidity
function batchCreatePolicies(
    address[] calldata tokens,
    uint256[] calldata amounts,
    uint256[] calldata durations
) external {
    Multiprocess mp = new Multiprocess(tokens.length);

    for (uint i = 0; i < tokens.length; i++) {
        mp.addJob(
            2000000,                    // Gas limit
            0,                          // ETH value
            address(this),              // Target
            abi.encodeWithSignature(
                "_createPolicyInternal(address,address,uint256,uint256)",
                msg.sender, tokens[i], amounts[i], durations[i]
            )
        );
    }

    mp.run(); // Parallel execution across all policies
}
```
**Parallelism**: Process 100 policies in a single transaction with parallel execution

#### Automated Claim Settlement (Oracle-Based)
```solidity
function autoSettleClaims(
    address tokenAddress,
    bytes32 priceId,
    int64 currentPrice,
    int64 referencePrice
) external {
    // Calculate price drop
    uint256 dropPercentage = calculateDropPercentage(currentPrice, referencePrice);

    // If significant drop detected (e.g., >20%)
    if (dropPercentage >= 2000) { // 20% in basis points
        // Get all policies for this token
        bytes32[] memory relevantPolicies = getTokenPolicies(tokenAddress);

        // Batch settle using Multiprocess
        Multiprocess mp = new Multiprocess(relevantPolicies.length);
        for (uint i = 0; i < relevantPolicies.length; i++) {
            mp.addJob(
                1000000,
                0,
                address(this),
                abi.encodeWithSignature(
                    "_settlePolicyInternal(bytes32,uint256)",
                    relevantPolicies[i],
                    dropPercentage
                )
            );
        }
        mp.run(); // Settle all claims in parallel
    }
}
```
**Parallelism**: 10,000 claims settled simultaneously when rug pull detected

### 3. Premium Pool Management

```solidity
// ✅ Concurrent premium pool
U256Cumulative public premiumPool;

// Deposits (commutative)
function depositPremium(uint256 amount) internal {
    premiumPool.add(amount);  // Order-independent addition
}

// Withdrawals (commutative if within limits)
function payoutClaim(uint256 amount) internal {
    require(amount <= premiumPool.get(), "Insufficient pool");
    premiumPool.sub(amount);  // Order-independent subtraction
}
```

### 4. Risk Scoring System

```solidity
// Per-token concurrent risk scores
HashU256CumMap public tokenRiskScores;

function updateTokenRisk(address token, uint256 riskDelta) external {
    // Concurrent updates from multiple sources
    tokenRiskScores.set(bytes32(uint256(uint160(token))), int256(riskDelta));
}

function calculatePremium(address token, uint256 coverage) public view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 baseRate = 100; // 1%
    uint256 riskScore = uint256(tokenRiskScores.get(bytes32(uint256(uint160(token)))));

    // Higher risk = higher premium
    uint256 riskMultiplier = 100 + (riskScore / 100);
    return (coverage * baseRate * riskMultiplier) / (10000 * 100);
}
```

## Oracle Integration

### Mock Oracle (for DevNet)
```solidity
contract MockPriceOracle {
    mapping(address => uint256) public prices;
    mapping(address => uint256) public referencePrices;

    function updatePrice(address token, uint256 price) external {
        prices[token] = price;
    }

    function setReferencePrice(address token, uint256 price) external {
        referencePrices[token] = price;
    }

    function getDropPercentage(address token) external view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 current = prices[token];
        uint256 reference = referencePrices[token];
        if (reference == 0) return 0;

        if (current >= reference) return 0;
        return ((reference - current) * 10000) / reference;
    }
}
```

### Integration with Insurance Contract
- Policies store reference price at creation time
- Claims trigger price check via oracle
- If drop > threshold → auto-approve
- All validations happen in parallel

---

## Technical Advantages

### 1. Eliminates Contention Points
- ❌ No global arrays (every `.push()` is a bottleneck)
- ❌ No owner-only functions (single account bottleneck)
- ❌ No sequential counters (`++` creates conflicts)
- ✅ All operations use concurrent primitives
- ✅ Independent storage paths per user/token
- ✅ Commutative operations for aggregates

### 2. Maximizes Parallel Execution
- Policy creation: O(1) conflicts (none)
- Claim settlement: O(1) per claim (fully parallel)
- Risk updates: O(1) per token (concurrent map)
- Premium pool: O(1) with U256Cumulative

### 3. Real-World Scalability
- **Scenario**: New shitcoin launches, 10,000 users want insurance
- **Traditional chain**: 10,000 blocks * 12 sec = 33 hours
- **Arcology parallel**: 10 batches * 1 block = 10 seconds
- **Impact**: 12,000x faster time-to-coverage

### 4. Gas Efficiency
- Concurrent primitives optimize storage access
- Batch operations amortize fixed costs
- No wasted gas on failed transactions due to contention
